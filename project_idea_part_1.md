Users can search, update and delete this information. MIS is a desktop application and a GUI and DOS-based menu driven application which can run on any windows operating system and does not require any supporting or licenses software to run. Users can operate all the menu options using a mouse, despite this being a DOS based system.


# Unique ID management

UID Number is a number that would help the government to track down individuals and would make life far easier for citizens as they would not have to submit multiple documents each time they want to avail a new public, private and government service. This UID management system will contain personal details like name, sex, address, marital status, photo, identification mark and fingerprint biometric. UID will be a 12 digit alphanumeric number to provide more security. UID system manages a person’s needs in his/her lifespan by using a single UID i.e. the number is used in driving license, voter ID card, registration number in organisations, bank account, personal or professional details.

# Web-based application for automatic timetable generation

The manual system of timetable preparation in colleges is very monotonous and time-consuming which results in either the same teachers ending up with more than one class at a time or a number of classes conflicting at the same classroom. Due to a non-automatic perspective, absolute utilization of resources has proven ineffective. In order to deal with such problems, a mechanized system with a computer-aided timetable generator is designed. The system takes different inputs including number of subjects, teachers, maximum lectures a teacher can conduct, priority of subject and topics to be covered in a week or a lecture. It then creates a feasible timetable for working days of the week, making excellent application of all resources in the best possible way.

# Emotion-based music player

In this proposed system the facial expression extracted will generate a playlist automatically thereby reducing the effort and time involved in rendering the process manually. Testing of the system is done both on user dependent (dynamic) and user independent (static) dataset. An in-built camera captures the facial features. The accuracy of the emotion detection algorithm used in the system for real-time images is around 85-90%, while for static images it is around 98- 100%. The proposed algorithm on an average takes around 0.95-1.05 sec to generate an emotion-based music playlist. Thus, it yields better accuracy in terms of performance and computational time and reduces the designing cost, compared to the algorithms used in the literature survey.

# Distorted fingerprint verification system

Fingerprint matching is affected by non-linear distortion introduced in fingerprint impression during the image acquisition process. The proposed system operates in three stages: alignment based fingerprint matching, fuzzy clustering, and classifier framework. First, an enhanced input fingerprint image is aligned with the template and match score is computed. To improve the performance of the system, a fuzzy clustering based on distance and density clusters the feature set obtained earlier. Finally, a classifier framework finds the cost-sensitive classifier produces better results.

# Facial expression recognition

Facial Expression Recognition (FER) project is developed in C#, Microsoft visual studio .net. Robust recognition of facial expressions from images and videos is still a challenging task due to the difficulty in accurately extracting the useful emotional features. These features are often represented in different forms, like static, dynamic, point-based geometric or region-based appearance. Facial movement features including feature position and shape, are often caused by the movement of facial muscles during emotional expression.

# Student information system

# Secured mail system

To provide security to the organisational data, an organisation itself develops its own mailing system and the entire database resides at the organisation head. The employees of that particular organisation must communicate and with the admin through this mailing system only. As the database resides at the organisational head, he/she can check the database and the activities performed by the employees and whenever an employee leaves the organisation, the organisation admin can know the information and the transactions done by him. In this mailing system, we are using the encryption algorithm to provide authentication as well as the confidentiality to the data while transferring the data through the network.
