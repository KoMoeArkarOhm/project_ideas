## 1. A stock photos site with only weird or unique photos. Crying clowns, abandoned malls, giant wicker chairs‚Ä¶ that sort of thing.
## 2.Social network where people submit things they've created like articles they've written, products they've released, or YouTube videos. You view a list of them and promote the ones you like on your social media accounts. More promotions of other people's stuff buys your own posts a higher position on the site. 
## 3.A gamified GPS exploration app. You see a real-world map, but most of the map is covered in fog. (Gamers will recognize this as the "fog of war" common in real-time strategy games before you have explored an area.) As you explore the real world, the map is revealed. Users can define an area and see the percentage of that area they have explored. 
## 4.Anyone use Pinboard? It's a great social bookmarking app that picked up the pieces after del.icio.us dissolved. They have a cool "to read" feature where you can bookmark an article and mark that you want to read it later. Pinboard Reader is an Instapaper/Pocket-style app that hooks into their API. 
## 5.A daily ‚Äúexercise‚Äù app for entrepreneurs. Instead of a physical workout, this gets users to step outside their comfort zones through one activity per day. This helps build the risk-taking muscles entrepreneurs need and erodes their fear of rejection. 
## 6.A blogging platform which automatically links between users' posts. It matches words and phrases common in posts, preferring longer matches. For example, if this project description were a post on the platform, the words "blogging platform" might automatically be linked to another user's post on the top blogging platforms in 2018. Links change over time. 
## 7.OK, so the names of these aren't all home runs. üòâ Did you ever try Miitomo? Nintendo's social network? I loved the way it used prompts to spark interaction between friends. The Fam does this for families, getting them communicating, learning more about one another, and becoming closer through smart, engaging prompts. 
## 8.The social network that only lets each user post once per year. Better make it good! 
## 9.A notes app with multiple entries per note. When the user launches the app, they select a note. This adds a new entry for that note automatically tagged with the current date, time, and location. Entries can be sorted and filtered on this metadata. Great for resolving messy problems and tracking what you did. 
## 10.A widget or plugin that pops up a modal on exit intent. (You've probably seen these before. You're about to close a page when a modal pops up giving you a "final offer" of sorts to keep you from leaving.) The twist is that the content of the modal is customizable based on how long the user was on the page.
